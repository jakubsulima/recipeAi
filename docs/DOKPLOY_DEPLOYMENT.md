# Dokploy Deployment Guide

This project is ready to run as a Docker Compose app in Dokploy using [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml).

Production deployment is image-only: Dokploy pulls prebuilt images, it does not build from source during deploy.

CI image publishing source: [.github/workflows/docker-ci.yml](../.github/workflows/docker-ci.yml)

Published image tags:
- `latest` on push to default branch
- `sha-<short-commit>` on push to default branch

## 1. Recommended Topology

Option A: Single public domain (simpler)
- Public: https://app.example.com -> frontend service (port 80)
- Configure Dokploy path routing /api/* -> backend service (port 8080)
- Set VITE_API_URL=/api/

Option B: Separate API domain
- Public: https://app.example.com -> frontend service (port 80)
- Public: https://api.example.com -> backend service (port 8080)
- Set VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com/
- Set ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://app.example.com

## 2. Dokploy App Setup

1. Create a new application from your Git repository.
2. Choose Docker Compose deployment mode.
3. Set compose file path to docker-compose.yml.
4. Set branch and webhook auto-deploy as needed.

If GHCR packages are private, configure Dokploy registry credentials so image pulls can authenticate.

## 3. Service Exposure in Dokploy

Option A (single domain):
- Expose frontend service only, target port 80.
- Do not expose backend service publicly.

Option B (separate API domain):
- Expose frontend service, target port 80.
- Expose backend service, target port 8080.

Database service should never be publicly exposed.

## 4. Environment Variables in Dokploy

Copy-ready presets are available in [DOKPLOY_ENV_PRESETS.md](DOKPLOY_ENV_PRESETS.md).

Minimum required:
- BACKEND_IMAGE
- FRONTEND_IMAGE
- DB_IMAGE
- POSTGRES_DB
- POSTGRES_USER
- POSTGRES_PASSWORD
- GEMINI_API_KEY
- ALLOWED_ORIGINS
- JWT_SECRET_KEY

Recommended:
- GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID
- TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS
- JWT_COOKIE_SECURE=true
- JWT_COOKIE_SAME_SITE=Lax
- FREE_PLAN_RECIPE_LIMIT=75
- PAID_PLAN_RECIPE_LIMIT=-1
- FRONTEND_PORT=80
- SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod

Frontend build-time variables are configured in GitHub Actions repository variables (not Dokploy runtime env):
- `VITE_API_URL` (default `/api/`)
- `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`

For immutable deploys, point image variables to SHA tags, for example:
- `BACKEND_IMAGE=ghcr.io/<namespace>/<repo>-backend:sha-abc1234`
- `FRONTEND_IMAGE=ghcr.io/<namespace>/<repo>-frontend:sha-abc1234`
- `DB_IMAGE=ghcr.io/<namespace>/<repo>-db:sha-abc1234`

## 5. First Deployment Checklist

1. Deploy once and inspect logs of frontend/backend/db.
2. Confirm backend health endpoint responds.
3. Verify frontend can call login/refresh endpoints.
4. Confirm no CORS errors in browser console.
5. Confirm cookies are set with expected attributes.
6. Confirm DB migrations and startup complete successfully.

Update flow after each release:
1. Push to `main` and wait for CI image publish.
2. Update `BACKEND_IMAGE`, `FRONTEND_IMAGE`, `DB_IMAGE` to the new SHA tags in Dokploy.
3. Redeploy (Dokploy will pull new images).

## 6. Scaling Guidance

With Dokploy and Docker Compose:
- Scale frontend replicas first if traffic grows.
- Keep backend stateless and scale backend replicas next.
- Keep DB single-primary unless you add a managed DB/replication setup.
- Add external observability (logs/metrics) before increasing replicas aggressively.

For larger scale (multiple teams/services with advanced scheduling), consider k3s/Kubernetes later. For now, Dokploy is a strong operational middle ground.
